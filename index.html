        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Swibo</strong> (“the Game”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects,
        uses, and shares information when you play our iOS mobile game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swibo is developed and published by <strong>Jussi Rinta-Jaskari</strong> (“Developer”, “we”, “us”).<br>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, you can contact us at:
        <a href="mailto:swibo@majrstudios.com">swibo@majrstudios.com</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> ask you to create an account and we do <strong>not</strong> collect personal
      contact information such as your name, postal address, or phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some information is collected automatically through third-party services integrated into the Game,
      such as Google AdMob and Firebase.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
    <p>When you play Swibo, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (such as device model, operating system and version)</li>
      <li>IP address (which may be used to approximate your country or region)</li>
      <li>Device identifiers (including Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers – IDFA)</li>
      <li>App usage data (such as session length, screens viewed, and interactions)</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data (to help us diagnose issues)</li>
      <li>Advertising data (such as ad impressions, clicks, and interactions)</li>
      <li>General location information (country-level, not precise GPS)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 No Player Accounts</h3>
    <p>
      Swibo does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide login credentials.
      We do not intentionally collect names, email addresses, or other direct identifiers from players within the Game.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above in order to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and improve the Game and its features</li>
      <li>Understand how players interact with the Game</li>
      <li>Monitor performance and fix crashes or technical issues</li>
      <li>Measure the effectiveness of in-game content and features</li>
      <li>Serve advertisements (including contextual or non-personalized ads, depending on your settings)</li>
      <li>Generate aggregated analytics and usage statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
    <p>
      Swibo uses third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) and services. These partners may collect and process
      data as described in their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads within the Game. AdMob may collect device identifiers,
      IP address, app usage information, and ad interaction events in order to serve and measure ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about how Google uses data, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Firebase Analytics (App Analytics)</h3>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to understand how players interact with Swibo, such as which features
      are used most and how often the Game is opened. Firebase collects anonymized or pseudonymized usage data
      (for example, events, session duration, and device information).
    </p>
    <p>
      For more details, please refer to the Firebase Privacy documentation:<br>
      <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Google Analytics (via Firebase export)</h3>
    <p>
      We may export certain Firebase Analytics data to <strong>Google Analytics</strong> in order to create aggregated
      reports and better understand overall usage trends. This data is used in an aggregated and anonymized form and
      is not used to personally identify individual users.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about Google Analytics and privacy, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Swibo uses Google AdMob to display ads. Depending on your device settings and consent choices, ads may be
      personalized or non-personalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      On iOS, you can control certain aspects of ad tracking in your device settings, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reset your advertising identifier (IDFA)</li>
      <li>Allow or deny apps permission to track you</li>
      <li>Limit ad tracking and personalized ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Swibo respects these system-level privacy controls where applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Swibo is <strong>not directed to children under the age of 13</strong>, and we do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us,
      please contact us at <a href="mailto:swibo@majrstudios.com">swibo@majrstudios.com</a>, and we will take steps
      to delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain analytics and diagnostic data only for as long as necessary to operate, maintain, and improve the Game,
      and to comply with legal obligations. Our third-party service providers (such as Google) may retain data in
      accordance with their own data retention policies.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your country or region, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access information we hold about you</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of certain data</li>
      <li>The right to object to or limit certain types of processing</li>
      <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority</li>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the data processed in connection with
      the Game. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure,
      and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our third-party providers (such as Google) may process data on servers located in various countries. These data
      transfers are managed by those providers and may be subject to international data protection laws and frameworks.
